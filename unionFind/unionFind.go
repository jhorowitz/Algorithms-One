package unionFind

/*
Given a set of N objects.
 - Union command: connect two objects
 - Find / connected query: Is there a path connecting the two objects


Applications involve manipulating objects of all kinds

 - Metallic sites in a composite system


We assume "is connected to" is an equivalence relation.
 - Reflexive: p is connected to p
 - Symmetric: If p is connected to q then q is connected to p
 - Transitive: If p is connected to q and q is connected to r then p is connected to r

Connected components: Maximal set of objects that are mutually connected
